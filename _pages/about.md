## The Authors
I value my privacy but feel compelled to give back to the open source community, which has given me so much. I have elected not to provide much information about myself. This is a concious choice that stems from my rather old fasioned notion regarding personal privacy. I ask those of you that are cleaver enough to devine who I am to keep it to themselves. The less shy contributors to this site are given their due where appropriate.
